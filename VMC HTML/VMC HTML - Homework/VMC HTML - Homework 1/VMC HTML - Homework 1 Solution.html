        <b>Shin Chan in India: </b>
                A Hindi dub of the anime started airing in India on Hungama TV on June 19, 2006, Later in Tamil dub and Telugu dub.<br>
                There were complaints from parents over the main character's behavior and the attitudes exhibited towards elders on the show, both of which were seen as a negative influence on children. The series was banned in October 2008 by Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (India) on account of heavy nudity. Before the ban, the Hindi version of Crayon Shin-chan gained up to 60% of the channel's market share. After many requests from fans, the Indian censor boards heavily edited the content and revived the Indian dub on March 27, 2009. The jokes were edited to be more family-friendly, words like "Leader" and "Hamburger" were muted and all mentions of "alcohol" were replaced by mentions of "juice". Scenes that have been cut include instances of Shin-chan performing either the "Mr. Elephant" dance or the "butt-shaking" dance, and instances of Nene's mother beating up a stuffed toy in anger.<br>
                Only 13 films of Shin-chan have been dubbed in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu and have aired on Hungama TV.<br>
                But starting from 1 May 2017, No new films of Crayon Shin-chan will be aired on India and dubbed in Hindi, Tamil and Telugu. The license is held by Spacetoon India.<br><br><br>
