# VMC-CBJr
These folders contain all the class notes, homework (assignments), and homework solution of Python taught by Manmohan Bhaiya and Rahul Bhaiya and of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript taught by Sanjeet Ma'am and Mosina Ma'am on Coding Blocks Junior YouTube channel. <br>
VMC is there in the name because I came to know about <b>Coding Blocks Junior<b> through <b>Vidyamandir Classes (VMC)<b>.<br><br>
